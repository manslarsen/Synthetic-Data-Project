2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Temporary residence permits: 
A temporary residence permit gives non-Dutch persons permission to remain in the Netherlands for more than three months. There are two types of temporary permits: temporary asylum permits and temporary ordinary permits. In principle, permits are granted for a maximum period of five years. Thereafter, one can qualify for a residence permit for an unlimited period.

Asylum residence permit:
Individuals whose asylum request is granted, receive a residence permit for asylum. An asylum residence permit may cover an asylum application from the same or from a previous year.

Figures include invited refugees until 2011 (approximately 500 per year).

Ordinary residence permit:
Individuals whose request for a regular permit has been granted receive an ordinary permit. They did not come here for asylum, but for example to work, to study, for family reunification or for family formation. Non-Dutch persons who want to stay in the Netherlands for more three months and are not EU, EER or Swiss nationals, need a residence permit.

Single permit for residence and labour:
This permit is available from April 1st, 2014. The Single Permit combines the residence permit and the work permit. The applicants request for both in one application.

Invited refugees:
These are refugees selected under the resettlement program of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and invited by the Dutch government to come to the Netherlands. They receive a residence permit without having to submit an application.

Explanation of symbols:
Empty cell : figure not applicable
. : figure is unknown, insufficiently reliable or confidential
* : provisional figure 
** : revised provisional figure

The figures in this table have been rounded to the nearest five, to prevent possible identification of individuals. If the number of first asylum requests by one particular nationality exceeds 50 in any given year, this nationality will be included separately in the tables. As a result there may be a discrepancy between the sum of nationalities and the total. Until 2011 the invited refugees are included in the number of temporary asylum residence permits  (about 500 per year).
